_"Hands-On with CSE" tutorial series_

April 26, 2019

**Description:** PyTorch allows you to easily train and run machine learning models. It uses standard Python methods for writing code, so it's both simple and powerful. We will cover the core automatic differentiation capabilities of PyTorch, training deep neural networks, using GPUs and parallel computation, managing training and test data, saving and loading models, and visualizing training progress. We will assume a good knowledge of Python and NumPy, and basic knowledge of machine learning with neural nets.
